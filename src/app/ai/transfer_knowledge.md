How do I send money with Wise?
The Process of Sending Money with Wise
To send money with Wise, a user must first sign up with an email address and create a
password.
Wise must verify a user before they are able to send money.
To start a transfer, a user selects 'Send' from the Home screen.
The user must add a new recipient or choose from an existing list of recipients.
To add a new recipient, the user selects their currency and can find them by their @Wisetag,
email, phone, or by adding their bank details.
The user must enter either the amount they want to send or the amount they want the
recipient to get.
A user can schedule a transfer for a future date by clicking the calendar icon.
Before finalizing the payment, a confirmation screen allows the user to check all details of
the transfer.
Wise displays the fees and estimated arrival time for each available payment option.
It is often cheapest to pay for a transfer from a bank account.
After receiving the money, Wise confirms the transfer via email or in the Wise app.
Wise informs both the sender and the recipient when the money is on its way.
Sent payments appear under 'Transactions' on the home screen and can be organized by
category.
How long does a transfer usually take?
Factors Affecting Wise Transfer Speed
The time a Wise transfer takes is affected by the currencies being sent, the payment method
used, and banking hours.
A general time estimate can be found using the transfer calculator, but a more accurate
estimate is provided when the transfer is actually set up.
The currency conversion process can take up to 2 working days.
Transfer speed depends on how quickly the recipient's bank can process the payment.
Different payment methods have different speeds; for instance, card payments are normally
instant, while bank transfers may take longer.
Wise can only process transfers during normal banking hours, and public holidays can cause
delays.
Required security checks, such as verifying a user's ID, address, or source of funds, can add
extra time to a transfer.
Can I send exact amounts?
Sending an Exact Recipient Amount with Wise
To have a recipient get an exact amount, the user must enter the amount in the recipient's
currency under the 'Your recipient gets exactly' field.
When an exact recipient amount is specified, Wise automatically calculates the total amount
the sender needs to pay, including fees and taxes.
To ensure the recipient gets the exact amount, the sender must pay for the transfer within
the guaranteed exchange rate period.
Payment methods like debit or credit cards take seconds, while bank transfers may take
longer to arrive at Wise.
If a user pays from their Wise balance, the exact amount can be taken from the balance
even if the exchange rate is not guaranteed, provided there are sufficient funds.
Sending an Exact Sender Amount with Wise
A user can choose to send an exact amount in their own currency by entering it in the 'You
send exactly' field.
When sending an exact amount of their own currency, the 'Your recipient gets' field is
automatically updated to show what the recipient will receive after fees and taxes.
For Wise business accounts, the fees and taxes needed for the transfer will be included in
the 'You send' amount.
How do you notify me about a transfer?
Wise Transfer Notifications
Wise sends an email when it has received the sender's money.
Wise sends another email when the transfer has been paid out.
A notification that a transfer has been paid out does not mean the funds have reached the
recipient's account yet.
Wise will also send an email if there is an issue with a transfer.
Users should check their email's spam or junk folder if they do not receive a notification
email.
While most contact is via email, Wise may get in touch by phone if needed.
How do I download a transfer
confirmation?
Wise Transfer Confirmation Document
After a transfer is complete, the sender can download a transfer confirmation document,
which serves as a receipt confirming the transaction.
Only the sender of a transfer can download the transfer confirmation document.
Recipients who need a transfer confirmation document should contact the sender to have it
forwarded to them.
The transfer confirmation includes details such as the transfer number and the banking
partner reference.
For certain currencies, the transfer confirmation will also include a unique tracking number.
For businesses, the registered business address is shown on the transfer confirmation.
How to Download a Wise Transfer Confirmation
On the Wise website, a user can download a transfer confirmation by going to 'Home,
'
selecting the transfer, clicking the three dots, and choosing 'Get transfer confirmation'
.
On the Wise app, a user can download a transfer receipt by going to 'Home,
' selecting the
transfer, tapping 'Details,
' and then selecting 'Get PDF receipt' on iOS or 'Download transfer
receipt' on Android.
The transfer confirmation document opens as a PDF file that can be saved to a computer or
shared.
Changing the Language of a Wise Transfer Confirmation
To download a transfer confirmation in a different language on the website, the user must
first change their account language in their profile settings.
To change the language for the Wise app, the user must change the language settings on
their phone, not within the app itself.
After selecting the preferred language, the user can download the confirmation document by
following the standard steps.
Do I need to pay any tax on transfers?
Taxes on Wise Transfer Fees
Wise may be required to collect tax on its transfer fee in accordance with local tax laws.
An example of a local tax is the Brazilian IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras), which
is a financial operations tax that may be applied to Brazilian Real (BRL) transactions.
When transactional taxes apply, they are either included in the total fee or shown separately
at the time of payment.
These transactional taxes will not impact the amount sent to the recipient.
User Tax Obligations for Wise Transfers
Wise pays out the agreed-upon amount to the recipient and does not withhold any taxes on
the money being transferred.
Depending on the nature of a transfer, the sender, the recipient, or both may be required to
declare and pay tax.
Wise cannot provide advice on whether a specific transfer is subject to tax.
For tax advice regarding a transfer, it is recommended that users consult a financial advisor
or the relevant tax authority.
How can I repeat a transfer?
Repeating a Wise Transfer
A user can automatically repeat a previous Wise transfer from three different places.
When logged into Wise, a user can repeat a transfer by clicking on the desired transaction
and selecting 'Repeat transfer'.
A transfer can be repeated from a completed transfer's page by clicking 'Repeat this
transfer' in the top right-hand corner.
A user can repeat a transfer from a payment confirmation page by using the link in the
completion email to access the status page, then clicking 'Repeat this transfer'.
Before confirming and paying for a repeated transfer, the user will have an opportunity to
review all of its details.
Repeating a transfer creates a new transfer with the exact same details as the previous
one, with the exception that it uses the current mid-market exchange rate.
Can I send from a joint bank account?
Funding a Wise Transfer from a Joint Bank Account
A user can send money from a joint bank account if they are one of the account holders.
To send from a joint bank account, the user's name on the bank account must match the
name on their Wise account.
When setting up a transfer from a joint account, Wise will ask the user to enter the name of
the other bank account holder.
Providing the other holder's name helps Wise identify that the money is coming from a joint
account.
Verifying a Joint Bank Account with Wise
Normally, a user does not need to prove that a joint bank account is in their name.
If a bank provides incorrect name details for a joint account, Wise will email the user to
request a proof of joint account document.
When proof is requested for a joint account, the transfer is paused until the document has
been received and approved.
Wise will typically check a proof of joint account document within 2 working days of receiving
it.
A valid proof of joint account document can be either a screenshot or a PDF of a joint bank
statement.
The proof of joint account document must clearly show the user's name, the bank's name,
and the account number.
Can I send from someone else's bank
account?
Wise Transfer Funding and Account Name Rules
In most cases, the name on the bank account used to send money must match the name on
the sender's Wise account.
Funding a Wise Transfer with a Wise Business Account
A user can send money from a business bank account on behalf of a business they
represent, but they must have a Wise Business account.
The name on the business bank account must match the business name that is registered
with the user's Wise Business account.
Procedure for Transfers Funded by a Third Party
If someone else has already paid for a transfer using a user's Wise account, Wise will not be
able to process the money and will pause the transfer.
In the event of a third-party payment, the user needs to cancel the transfer themselves.
After the user cancels a transfer that was funded by a third party, Wise will refund the money
back to the original sender's bank account.
Sending with Swift
Wise and the Swift Payment Network
Swift payments, also referred to as international wires, are a type of international transfer
sent using the Swift international payment network.
The Swift international payment network is one of the world's largest financial messaging
systems.
Wise can send or receive certain currencies using Swift payments.
A Swift payment is required when sending a payment in a currency that differs from the
currency of the recipient's bank.
An example of when to use Swift is sending United States Dollars (USD) to a country outside
of the US.
When Wise Uses Swift Payments
Wise pays out via Swift when sending United States Dollars (USD) to countries outside of
the US.
Wise uses Swift to pay out British Pounds (GBP) to countries outside of the UK.
Wise utilizes Swift for transfers of more than 1 million Japanese Yen (JPY) to any country.
Wise sends Euros (EUR) via Swift to banks that are not part of the Single Euro Payments
Area (SEPA) and to countries outside of the SEPA zone.
How to Send a Wise Swift Transfer
When sending a Swift payment, it is recommended to use an International Bank Account
Number (IBAN) whenever possible.
Before initiating a transfer to a new recipient, the sender should ask the recipient to
double-check that their banking details are correct.
The Wise system validates recipient details, including name, address, bank account number,
and the Swift or BIC number, to ensure compliance with Swift rules.
This recipient validation process helps to prevent rejected transfers and payment delays.
To avoid errors, the account number field should only contain the account number, without
any extra information, spaces, or separators.
If the system detects incorrect recipient details, it will prompt the user to review them before
continuing with the payment.
Timing of Wise Swift Transfers
Swift payments usually take 1-6 working days to arrive at their destination.
Swift payments may take longer than the typical timeframe due to time differences between
the sending and receiving countries.
The involvement of multiple intermediary banks in the delivery process can also cause
delays to Swift transfers.
Fees for Wise Swift Transfers
Wise charges a fee to send a Swift payment, and users can check the pricing page for the
latest fees in their region.
While a Swift payment is in transit, correspondent banks involved in the process may deduct
their own handling fees.
Wise does not have control over the extra costs that other banks might apply to a transfer.
Limits on Wise Swift Transfers
Users with a profile address in Australia, Japan, or the United States have a daily cumulative
limit of 5 million GBP or its equivalent for Swift transfers.
This daily limit allows a user to send up to a total of 5 million GBP or its equivalent to
different Swift recipients in different currencies within one day.
If a user's address is outside of Australia, Japan, or the United States, regular Swift
transaction-based limits will apply instead of the daily cumulative limit.
How can I check the status of my
transfer?
Checking the Status of a Wise Transfer
To check the status of a transfer, a user can log in to their Wise account and click 'Details' on
the specific transfer they wish to track.
Wise provides a money tracker so users can see where their money is at every step of the
process.
If a transfer has been sent by Wise but has not yet appeared in the recipient's account, the
sender can download a PDF transfer receipt to send to the recipient's bank.
To get a transfer receipt, the user must go to their activity list on the Home screen, click
'Details' on the transfer, and then select 'Get PDF receipt'
.
Common Reasons for Wise Transfer Delays
Wise may need to perform extra verification depending on the transfer amount and currency,
which can cause delays.
If extra verification is needed, Wise will send an email to the user specifying what information
is required.
A mistake in the recipient's details can cause a transfer to be delayed.
When recipient details are incorrect, some banks may take longer to process the transfer,
while others will send the money back to Wise.
When the money tracker shows 'Transfer Sent'
, it means Wise has sent the money, but it
can still take a few working days for the recipient's bank to process it.
Transfers sent over a weekend or before a holiday may only be processed on the next
working day because banks are closed.
When will my money arrive?
Wise Money Transfer Arrival Estimates
When a user makes a transfer with Wise, they will receive an estimate for when the money
is expected to arrive.
If a Wise transfer is stated to be due "today,
" it signifies that the money should have already
arrived.
The arrival status of a Wise transfer may say "due today" because some banks require a few
hours to process incoming transfers from Wise.
Wise Money Transfer Delays Due to Incorrect Recipient Details
Minor errors in a recipient's name, such as spelling "John Smith" as "Jon Smith,
" will typically
not cause a delay for transfers to most countries.
For certain currencies, like the Japanese Yen (JPY), a typo in the recipient's name can
cause an issue with the transfer.
If a recipient's account number is incorrect, the money transfer could be delayed or returned
to Wise.
Wise will immediately notify the sender if a transfer is returned.
Impact of Weekends and Holidays on Wise Money Transfers
The banking systems in some countries do not operate on weekends or holidays.
Wise's delivery time estimates account for the banking hours of the destination country.
In some regions, banks cease processing transfers early on Fridays.
If a transfer is scheduled to arrive on a Friday, it might not appear in the recipient's account
until the next business day.
Troubleshooting a Missing Wise Money Transfer
If a recipient has not received a transfer, they should check their bank statement for a
transaction from Wise, not necessarily the sender's name.
A transfer might also come from one of Wise's partners, but the amount and reference
should still match.
If the recipient's bank account details are not correct, the money could take longer to arrive
or be returned.
If a recipient's bank account is in a different currency than the one sent, their bank might
convert the money, resulting in a different final amount.
How to Get a Wise Money Transfer Receipt
A recipient's bank may have trouble processing a transfer, meaning they have the money but
have not deposited it into the recipient's account.
A Wise transfer receipt contains all of Wise's bank details and sometimes tracking numbers.
To get a PDF receipt for a transfer, the user must log into their Wise account, click on the
specific transfer, and then select the option to "Get PDF receipt"
.
The user can then save the PDF receipt and send it to their recipient.
Rules for Transfers from Wise Interest or Stocks
There are daily sending thresholds for money sent from Wise Interest or Stocks that, if
exceeded, may cause an added delay.
Why does it say my transfer's complete
when the money hasn't arrived yet?
Meaning of a "Complete" Wise Transfer Status
Wise marks a transfer as 'Complete' when the money has been sent to the recipient's bank.
Wise includes a buffer in its arrival estimates to allow for the receiving bank to process and
release the funds.
Wise Transfer Delays at the Receiving Bank
One reason a transfer marked 'Complete' may not have arrived is that the receiving bank is
still processing the money.
Some banks can take up to one working day to release money they have received.
The recipient can ask their bank to speed up the processing of the transfer by providing
them with a transfer receipt.
How to Handle Unrecognized Wise Transfers
A recipient might not recognize an arrived transfer because they are looking for the sender's
name on their bank statement instead of a transaction from Wise.
A Wise transfer might also originate from one of the company's banking partners.
If a transfer comes from a banking partner, the recipient can identify it using the reference
number.
If the recipient's bank account is in a different currency from the one sent, their bank will
convert the money again.
When the recipient's bank converts the currency of a transfer, the final amount received
might be different than expected.
Why do some transfers take longer?
General Information on Wise Transfer Speeds
Wise informs users upfront when their money is expected to arrive and provides email
updates once the transfer is initiated.
Any transfer involving a currency conversion may take up to two working days to be
processed.
Users can monitor the current status of their transfer by tracking it.
How Payment Methods Affect Wise Transfer Speed
The speed of a transfer is influenced by the chosen payment method, as some are faster
than others.
Wise indicates the processing time for each payment method during the transfer setup
process.
When paying by card, the transfer can typically begin immediately because card payments
are usually instant.
Bank payments may take longer depending on the currency, with a potential processing time
of two working days, which can be extended by holidays.
A Swift transfer, which is a global payment involving multiple banks, requires Wise to wait for
the funds to arrive, which can take 2-5 working days.
Impact of Weekends and Holidays on Wise Transfers
The transfer process can be slowed down by factors outside of Wise's control, such as
banking hours, weekends, and public holidays.
If money is sent over a weekend or just before a holiday, it might not be processed until the
following working day.
Wise relies on banks to send money, so transfers can only be processed when banks are
open.
For urgent transfers, it is advisable to plan around weekends and public holidays.
Delays Due to Incorrect Recipient Details in a Wise Transfer
If there is an error in the recipient's details, the receiving bank will likely reject the payment
and return it.
The return of a payment due to incorrect details can take several days, depending on the
currency, payment method, and bank operating hours.
Delays Due to Wise Security Checks
Wise, as a regulated financial institution, is legally required to conduct security checks on
customers and their payments.
These security checks may require verification of a user's ID, address, or the source of the
funds, which can add extra time to the transfer.
The security check process cannot be expedited by the user.
Wise will contact the user if any information is needed for a security check.
Delays Caused by the Recipient's Bank in a Wise Transfer
After Wise sends the money, the recipient's bank is responsible for processing and clearing
the funds.
The time it takes for a bank to clear funds can vary, with some banks taking up to two
working days for certain currencies.
Once the money is with the recipient's bank, Wise cannot control the speed of payment
processing.
A recipient can ask their bank to clear the money faster by providing them with the transfer
receipt.
Wise cannot directly share payment details with the recipient.
What is a proof of payment?
Wise Proof of Payment Definition and Format
A proof of payment for Wise can be a receipt in the form of a scan, a photo, or a PDF file.
A screenshot from an online bank can also serve as a proof of payment for Wise.
Required Information for a Wise Proof of Payment
A proof of payment must clearly show the user's name and account number, as well as their
bank's name.
The document must display the details for TransferWise Ltd or its partner bank, including the
account number.
The date the transfer was initiated must be visible on the proof of payment.
The proof of payment needs to show the amount that was sent to Wise.
The currency in which the money was sent to Wise must be included in the proof of
payment.
The reference that the user added to their transfer must be shown on the proof of payment.
Submitting a Wise Proof of Payment
Wise does not always require a proof of payment for a transfer.
If a proof of payment is needed, Wise will ask the user to upload it.
If all the required information does not fit into a single image, a user can submit two
screenshots.
When submitting two screenshots for proof of payment, both must show the user's bank
account number to confirm the information is for the same account.
Special Requirements for Wise Proof of Payment in Australia and New
Zealand
For users whose bank is in Australia or New Zealand, a screenshot of their online banking is
not sufficient for proof of payment.
In addition to a screenshot, users in Australia and New Zealand must provide a recent bank
statement showing their name, issue date, and bank details.
A user in Australia or New Zealand can submit only a bank statement if it contains all the
required proof of payment details.
What's a banking partner reference
number?
Wise Banking Partner Reference Number Definition
Wise provides a unique transfer number for every transfer, which is used for communication
with their support team.
For some transfers, Wise also supplies a banking partner reference number.
This number is called a banking partner reference number because Wise uses local banking
partners in each country to send out money.
How to Use a Wise Banking Partner Reference Number
The sender should provide the banking partner reference number to the recipient.
After a transfer is marked as completed on the sender's Wise account, the recipient can use
the banking partner reference number to check the transfer's status.
The recipient must give the banking partner reference number to their bank if they need to
inquire about the transfer.
Alternative Names for Wise Banking Partner Reference Numbers
Banks in different countries might refer to the banking partner reference number by a
different name.
In India, for example, banks may call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number or a
transaction reference number.
Why was I charged extra?
Wise Transfer Charges from Bank 'Cash Advance' Fees
There are three main reasons you could be charged more than expected when using a card
for a Wise transfer.
Some banks charge an additional fee, often called a 'cash advance'
, when you use your card
for a transfer.
When you pay for a transfer, Wise assigns a Merchant Category Code (MCC) to the
payment.
Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) are numbers that help financial institutions categorize the
payments they process.
Wise passes the MCC to your bank, and it is always 4829 or 6012.
The Merchant Category Codes 4829 and 6012 signify that a payment is a 'wire' or 'money
order'
.
Once your bank receives the Merchant Category Code (MCC) from Wise, it can decide how
to charge for that payment.
Some banks will charge a fee for certain Merchant Category Codes (MCCs).
Banks might charge your transfer as a 'cash advance' or 'cash withdrawal'
, which could
result in an extra charge.
The decision to apply a 'cash advance' fee is at the discretion of the bank that issued your
card, and Wise has no control over it.
You can call your bank to check how they charge for the Merchant Category Code (MCC)
assigned to your payment.
If your bank charged your transfer as a cash advance or cash withdrawal, you can ask them
why and explain the payment was not cash-related.
Wise Transfer Charges from Currency Conversion
You may be charged extra if your card is in a different currency than the currency you are
sending from.
For example, an extra charge can occur if you send GBP to USD but the card you use is
linked to a bank account holding EUR.
If the currency you pay with is different from the currency you send, your bank will convert
your money using its own exchange rate.
Your bank's exchange rate is not the Wise rate, and it will likely add an extra cost to your
transfer.
To avoid extra conversion fees, you should always pay for a transfer with a card that uses
the same currency you are sending from.
Wise Transfer Charges from Using a Different Card Type
You might be charged differently if you set up a transfer to pay with one card type but
actually pay with another.
For instance, this can happen if you choose to pay with your debit card but then enter your
credit card details at the time of payment.
Your Wise transfer will still be processed if you pay with a different card type than you
selected.
In some countries, Wise applies different fees for different card types.
In general, credit cards and corporate cards might be more expensive to use for Wise
transfers.
Wise will send you a notification explaining the charge if you are charged differently for using
a more expensive card.
Using a consumer debit card for your transfer may be cheaper.
I entered the wrong reference
Impact of an Incorrect Wise Transfer Reference
Entering the wrong reference when sending a Wise transfer to a personal bank account is
not usually a problem.
In most situations, an incorrect reference will not prevent your money from being delivered
successfully.
Wrong references can create problems if you are paying a company or business.
A wrong reference is also a problem when it is important that your money arrives with an
accurate reference.
If you are paying a bill or a business, you should contact the recipient to ask if an incorrect
reference will be an issue.
How to Cancel a Wise Transfer with an Incorrect Reference
The quickest solution for an incorrect reference is to cancel the transfer yourself and create
a new one with the correct reference.
The ability to cancel a transfer depends on how far along it is in the Wise system.
To check a transfer's status, log in to your Wise account, go to Home, and find the transfer in
your activity list.
You can cancel a transfer if its status is "set up,
" "your money's on its way to us,
" or "your
money's being processed.
"
When a transfer is canceled, Wise will return the money to your bank account.
After the cancellation, you can set up a new transfer using the correct reference.
Actions When a Wise Transfer with an Incorrect Reference Cannot Be
Canceled
If you do not see the cancel button or your transfer is complete, you need to contact your
recipient.
The conversion process at Wise is fast, and sometimes it may be too late to cancel a
transfer.
Once a transfer is marked as complete, the money has left the Wise system and is in the
banking system.
If you cannot cancel the transfer, you must inform the person or business you are paying
about the wrong reference.
You should ask the recipient to contact their bank to see if the money can still be delivered or
if their bank will send it back to Wise.
Process for Funds Returned to Wise
If the recipient's bank returns your money to Wise, you will be contacted via email.
After the money is returned to Wise, you can choose to set up the transfer again with the
correct reference.
Alternatively, when money is returned to Wise, you can cancel your transfer and receive a
refund.
I sent money to the wrong person
Initial Actions for a Wise Transfer Sent to the Wrong Person
There are two primary ways to resolve sending money to the wrong person.
You can either cancel the transfer yourself or, if the money has already reached the
recipient, you must contact them to ask for the money back.
The first step you should take is to check the status of your transfer.
To check the transfer status, log in to your Wise account, go to the Home screen to see your
activity list, and locate the transfer in question.
How to Cancel a Wise Transfer Sent to the Wrong Person
You have the option to cancel a transfer if the cancel button is visible on the transfer page.
If you successfully cancel the transfer, Wise will send the money back to your bank account.
After the funds are returned, you can create a new transfer to the correct person.
Actions When a Wise Transfer to the Wrong Person is Complete
The conversion process at Wise is fast, so it can sometimes be too late to cancel a transfer.
Once a transfer is marked as complete, the money has left the Wise system and entered the
banking system.
If you do not see an option to cancel the transfer, you should contact the recipient or the
recipient's bank.
You need to inform the recipient about the mistake and ask them to send the money back to
you or to Wise.
After the money has been returned, you can then set up a new transfer.
If you cannot cancel a transfer within your Wise account, Wise cannot cancel it for you
because the funds are no longer in the Wise system.
Bank Role in Incorrectly Addressed Wise Transfers
Some banks might automatically reject a transfer if the recipient's name does not match the
account number.
Whether a bank rejects a transfer due to a name mismatch varies depending on the
currency and the specific bank involved.
I sent the wrong amount
Wise Transfers with an Overpayment
If you accidentally pay too much money for a Wise transfer, you do not need to take any
action.
The Wise system is able to identify when a user has overpaid for a transfer.
Wise will proceed to send the originally intended amount to your recipient.
The excess money that was overpaid will be refunded to the bank account from which you
paid.
You are not required to contact Wise to receive a refund for an overpayment.
In the rare event that more information is needed for the refund, Wise will contact you by
email.
Wise Transfers with an Underpayment
If you have not sent enough money for a transfer, Wise will only complete it after the full
amount is paid.
Wise will pause your transfer if you did not pay the sufficient amount to fund it.
For some smaller transfers in certain currencies, the transfer amount will be automatically
adjusted down to the smaller amount you sent.
Resolving a Wise Transfer Underpayment
If you have not paid enough for a transfer, you can fix this by paying the outstanding amount.
To continue the transfer immediately, you can log in to your Wise account, find the transfer in
your Activity, and pay the remaining amount.
As an alternative, you can wait for Wise to send you an email to resolve the issue.
The email from Wise will ask if you want to complete the transfer using only the amount you
have already sent.
The email will also offer the option to pay the outstanding amount to complete the original
transfer total.
I forgot the reference
Forgetting Your Wise Payment Reference
If you did not include your unique reference number, which begins with a P, with your bank
transfer to Wise, the payment may still be linked without it.
Wise will send you an email regarding the payment, so you should check your inbox for
more information.
When Wise Cannot Link Your Payment
If Wise is unable to link your payment to your transfer, the money will be sent back to the
originating account.
Providing Proof of Payment to Wise
You will need to upload a proof of payment document if you believe the money was not
correctly returned by your bank.
A proof of payment document is also necessary if you sent the correct details, but the
payment was still not linked.
Wise will use the uploaded proof of payment document to locate and identify your money.
Once you have uploaded your proof of payment, Wise will get in touch with you to help.
I want to cancel a transfer that's
completed
Wise Transfer Cancellation Policy
A transfer that has been sent out or completed cannot be canceled.
All transfers completed by Wise are considered final.
Wise is unable to reverse or recall payments once they are completed.
Once a transfer is marked as completed on the Wise website, it cannot be canceled.
Wise's Role in Disputes
Wise cannot get involved in disputes between the sender and the recipient of a transfer.
Wise strongly recommends that users know and trust the person or business they are
sending money to before initiating a transfer.
Wise investigates all claims of fraud.
If Wise finds that an individual has fraudulently used their platform to receive money, they
will be blocked from receiving money through Wise in the future.
Incorrect Recipient Details
Wise cannot refund a transfer once the money has been sent out, even if the recipient's
details are incorrect.
If a transfer is sent to incorrect recipient details, the recipient's bank will typically reject the
payment and send it back to Wise.
If a recipient's bank sends money back to Wise, Wise will contact the sender to ask if they
want to update the details and resend the money or cancel the transfer for a refund.
Incorrect Transfer Amount or Unwanted Transfers
If a user sends the wrong amount or no longer wants to send the transfer, the recipient must
contact their bank and request that they reject the payment.
When a payment is rejected by the recipient's bank, the money is returned to Wise, and a
refund is issued to the sender.
Wise recommends that if you have sent money in error, you should contact the recipient and
ask them to return the money to you.
If a user accidentally sends a payment to themselves, they should transfer the money back.
I want to cancel a transfer I haven't paid
for
Checking the Status of a Wise Money Transfer
The ability to cancel a Wise money transfer depends on its current status.
Users can check the status of their Wise money transfer by going to their account.
A Wise money transfer that requires action from the user will be listed as a Task on their
home page.
If no action is needed, a Wise money transfer will appear in the user's Transactions.
How to Cancel a Wise Money Transfer You Haven't Paid For
A user can cancel a Wise money transfer themselves if they have set it up but have not yet
paid for it.
To cancel a Wise money transfer, a user must log in, go to their Home page, select the
transfer they want to cancel, and choose the 'Cancel transfer' option.
After a successful cancellation of a Wise money transfer, Wise will send a confirmation

How to Cancel a Wise Money Transfer When Your Money is On Its Way
A user can cancel a Wise money transfer themselves while their money is on its way to
Wise.
The 'Cancel transfer' button will still be visible and available to use even if the transfer status
message says "Your money may still be in your bank account" or "Sorry, we didn't get the
money yet"
.
When a user cancels a Wise money transfer at the stage where the money is on its way, the
refund may take a few business days to be returned to their account.
A refund for a cancelled Wise money transfer can only be processed after the money has
first arrived at Wise.
How to Cancel a Wise Money Transfer During Processing
A user may be able to cancel a Wise money transfer themselves during the processing
stage if the 'Cancel transfer' button is still visible.
If the 'Cancel transfer' button is not visible while a transfer is being processed, the user must
contact Wise to cancel it.
Users should contact Wise as soon as possible to cancel a transfer during processing, as
the conversion process can be very fast.
Wise can refund the money for a transfer being processed as long as the money has not yet
been sent out.
Inability to Cancel a Sent or Completed Wise Money Transfer
A user cannot cancel a Wise money transfer after it has been sent out or is completed.
Wise money transfers initiated over a weekend or just before a holiday may only be
processed on the next working day because they can only be sent when banks are open.
Wise Money Transfer Refund Information
If a user cancels a Wise money transfer after they have selected 'I've now paid'
, they might
need to re-enter their bank account details for the refund.
If a Wise money transfer was paid for by credit or debit card, the refund will be automatically
sent to the card that was used for payment.
When a refund for a Wise money transfer is sent back to a credit or debit card, Wise will not
ask for additional information from the user.
Why was my transfer cancelled?
Wise Transfer Cancellation Due to Non-Payment
If a user sets up a Wise transfer but does not pay for it within two weeks, Wise will
automatically cancel it.
If a transfer is cancelled for non-payment, the user can set up a new one, but they will not
receive the same exchange rate as the original transfer.
Wise only guarantees the exchange rate for a specific period, which is shown to the user
when they create the transfer.
The guaranteed rate and the time it is valid depend on the currency being sent and the
payment method.
If a transfer is cancelled due to non-payment, the original exchange rate would have already
expired within the two-week period.
Wise Transfer Cancellation Due to Missing Information
Wise may require more information from a user to complete a transfer.
If more information is needed, Wise will send an email to the user specifying what is
required.
If the user does not respond to the request for more information within two working days,
Wise will automatically cancel and refund the transfer.
Users should monitor their emails after initiating a transfer with Wise.
Wise Transfer Cancellation Due to Incorrect Recipient Details
If a user provides incorrect recipient details, such as a wrong name or account number, the
receiving bank will likely reject the payment.
When a payment is rejected due to incorrect details, the money is sent back to Wise.
After a transfer is returned due to incorrect details, Wise will ask the user if they want to edit
the details or cancel the transfer.
If the user does not respond within two working days after a transfer is returned, Wise will
cancel and refund the transfer.
If a transfer is cancelled due to incorrect details, the user can set up a new one without being
charged.
If the user edits the recipient details and the payment fails a second time, Wise will
automatically cancel the transfer.
Users can download a transfer receipt to double-check the recipient account details they
used.
It is important for users to carefully check their recipient's details for every transfer.
Wise Transfer Cancellation When No Transfer is Set Up
Sometimes, users send money to Wise without first setting up a transfer.
If Wise receives money without an associated transfer and the user has a balance in that
currency, the money will be automatically added to that balance.
An automatic deposit to a user's balance will appear on their activity list as "AutoCredit"
.
If a user sends money without creating a transfer and does not have a balance in that
currency, Wise will refund the money and notify the user by email.
A refund for money sent without a transfer will appear on the transaction list as
"AutoRefund"
.
Wise Transfer Cancellation by the Recipient's Bank
A recipient's bank may be unable to process a payment for various reasons, including
incorrect details, wrong currency, or exceeding a receiving limit.
Some banks have limits on the amount of money they can receive in a specific currency.
If a recipient's bank cancels a transfer, the recipient should contact their bank for assistance.
What to Do if a Wise Transfer is Cancelled
If a Wise transfer was cancelled and Wise sent an email with instructions, the user should
reply or follow those instructions to potentially resume the transfer.
If the time to follow the instructions has passed or the transfer cannot be resumed, the user
should set up a new transfer.
Why can cancelling transfers increase
fees?
Wise Transfer Fees and Costs
Wise charges a fee for every money transfer to cover the costs of the transfer.
The fee for a Wise transfer covers operational efforts like moving and exchanging the
money.
When a user cancels a Wise transfer, some of the transfer costs still occur.
If too many people cancel their Wise transfers, Wise may have to increase their fees to
cover the cost gap.
If fewer people cancel Wise transfers, Wise may be able to reduce fees in the future.
Wise's pricing is always based on their costs.
Consequences of Cancelling Wise Transfers Too Often
If you cancel Wise transfers too frequently, you will lose access to your guaranteed
exchange rate.
Losing the guaranteed rate means you will receive the live exchange rate at the time Wise
receives your money.
How to Avoid Cancelling Wise Transfers
To avoid cancelling transfers, you can open a Wise balance and add the money there before
transferring.
Money held in a Wise balance can be converted at any time, instantly.
Converting money from a Wise balance can be cheaper than making a direct transfer,
depending on the currencies involved.
Another way to avoid cancelling transfers is to use the Auto Conversions feature.
The Auto Conversions feature allows you to set a desired exchange rate, and Wise will
automatically convert the money when that rate is reached.
To use the Auto Conversions feature, you must have money in your Wise account.
When It Is Acceptable to Cancel a Wise Transfer
It is acceptable to cancel a Wise transfer if something has gone wrong.
How long do refunds take?
Wise Refund Timelines
The time it takes for a Wise refund to be paid back into your account depends on the way
you paid, the currency you used, and how long your bank takes to process refunds.
Wise Refunds for Bank Transfers
A refund for a bank transfer generally takes 0-3 working days to be returned to your account.
For more specific refund times for a bank transfer, you should find the currency you paid with
on the Wise platform, as the information is at the bottom of each currency's page.
Wise Refunds for Credit or Debit Cards
A refund for a payment made by credit or debit card can take up to 10 working days to go
back into your account.
The processing time for credit and debit card refunds is longer because both the Wise
provider and the bank that issued your card need to process the transaction.
For specific refund times based on your currency for a credit or debit card payment, you
should find the currency you paid with on the Wise platform.
Wise Refunds for Other Payment Types
If you paid for your transfer using another method, you can find refund information by
selecting the currency you paid with.
Refund information for other payment methods is located at the bottom of most currency
pages on the Wise platform.
Is there a refund fee?
Wise Transfer Refund Fees
Generally, there is no fee for cancelling and refunding a Wise transfer.
Wise will refund the full amount a user paid in most cases.
Wise Swift Transfer Refunds
An exception to the full refund policy applies to Swift transfers.
Where will you refund my money?
Wise Refund Destination
If a Wise transfer is cancelled or the recipient bank returns the funds, Wise will automatically
issue a refund to the original bank account or card used for payment.
When a transfer paid for from a Wise balance is cancelled, the refund will be returned to that
same Wise balance.
Wise Requests for Refund Account Details
Wise may request your bank account details for a refund because for some currencies, the
original paying account details are not visible to Wise.
When Wise requests bank account details for a refund, it is a safe and secure process, and
Wise cannot complete the refund without these details.
Wise may also ask for refund account details if a user has accidentally sent too much money
for a transfer.
A request for refund account details might occur if there is money left over after an amount
lock transfer has been completed.
How to Add Refund Bank Account Details to Wise
To add refund bank account details, the user must first select the transfer on hold from their
list of Transactions.
After selecting the held transfer, the user must choose the 'Fix your transfer' option.
The user must provide details for the same bank account that was originally used to pay for
the transfer.
When providing refund bank account details, all fields are mandatory to fill in.
A user will receive a refund confirmation email from Wise after successfully providing their
bank account details.
Wise Refunds to Brazilian Bank Accounts
Refunds for payments made from a bank account in Brazil are handled differently by Wise.
I want a refund to my Wise balance
Wise Refund Destination
Wise refunds money to the original account that was used for the payment.
A refund will only be credited to a user's Wise balance if the Wise balance was used to pay
for the transfer.
If you paid for a transfer from their bank account, Wise will refund the money directly to that
bank account.

Paying for a transfer
Wise Swift Payments
Swift payments, also known as international wires, are a type of international transfer sent
through the Swift international payment network.
The Swift international payment network is one of the world's largest financial messaging
systems.
Wise is able to send or receive certain currencies using a Swift payment.
Your bank is likely to charge a fee to make a Swift transfer to Wise.
During a Swift transfer, correspondent banks involved in the transit may also deduct handling
fees.
Your bank should be able to provide advice on what the potential fees for a Swift transfer
would be.
If money is sent directly to your Wise balance via Swift, Wise will deposit whatever amount is
received into your account.
To ensure Wise receives the full amount for your transfer, you should try to make sure your
bank covers any payment fees, which is known as an "OUR" Swift transfer.
Swift payments typically take 1 to 6 working days to arrive at their destination.
Swift payments can sometimes take longer than 6 working days due to time differences
between countries or the involvement of multiple intermediary banks.
Wise uses the Swift network to pay out when you send USD to countries outside of the US
or GBP to countries outside of the UK.

a Swift recipient, or when sending EUR to banks not part of SEPA and countries outside of

You can complete a bank transfer payment online, over the phone with your bank, or in
person at a bank branch.
When you choose "bank transfer" at the payment step in Wise, the system will display
Wise's bank account details and a payment reference.
For some transfers from a UK bank that are under the bank's limit, you may see a "Log in
and approve" option for a faster online bank transfer.
Wise will send you an email confirmation as soon as your money arrives in Wise's bank
account.
Wise Bank Transfer Requirements
The name on the bank account you use for a bank transfer must match the name on your
Wise account.
You must include the specific reference number provided by Wise when you make the bank
transfer payment from your bank.
You must send the exact amount of money that you specified when you set up the transfer
with Wise.
In most situations, you cannot have another person pay for your transfer from their bank
account.
Troubleshooting Wise Bank Card Payments
If a card payment fails, Wise will show you an error message.
A common reason for a card payment to be declined is that your bank has stopped the
payment, which can happen with unusually large payments or payments to new recipients.
To resolve a bank decline, you should contact your bank and confirm that you are making
the payment and that Wise is a trusted recipient.
A message about insufficient funds may occur if your bank has a per-transaction limit on
your card.
Some banks may treat card payments to Wise as cash withdrawals, which means your cash
withdrawal limit would apply.
Internet browser issues can sometimes cause problems with the 3D Secure verification step.
Antivirus or firewall software can interfere with card payments; you should ensure Wise is on
the list of safe merchants and that pop-ups are allowed.
Wise may sometimes stop a card payment to protect customers from potential fraudulent
activity or if the card is from an unsupported country.
Bank cards issued by Crédit Agricole and Le Crédit Lyonnais may be declined by the issuers
because they cannot meet recent regulations.
If a Crédit Agricole or Le Crédit Lyonnais card is declined, you can use a different bank card,
a mobile wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay, or pay by bank transfer instead.
Troubleshooting Wise Bank Transfer Payments
Forgetting to include the reference number with your bank transfer can delay your transfer
while Wise tries to locate your payment.
If you did not include the reference number, you will need to upload a proof of payment
document to help Wise find your money faster.
If you send Wise more money than needed for your transfer, the excess amount will be
refunded once the transfer is completed.
If you send Wise less money than needed, your transfer will be paused, and Wise will email
you for instructions.
Bank transfers can be delayed if they are sent outside of normal banking hours or around a
national holiday.
If the name on the bank account sending money does not match the name on the Wise
account, the transfer cannot be processed, with exceptions for joint accounts and Wise
Business payments.
If you enter Wise's bank details incorrectly, the payment will likely be rejected and returned
to your account by your bank.
If you create multiple transfers but only send one payment, the money will be automatically
linked to the oldest transfer you created.
Wise Payments with a Connected Bank Account (ACH) in the US
To pay with a connected bank account (ACH) in the US, you must first connect your bank
account and authorize a one-time debit.
After the initial setup, you must choose your bank and authorize a payment each time you
use the connected bank account (ACH) method.
Wise will automatically save your bank account details for future use when you make an
ACH payment by connecting your account.
On Wise business accounts, if you are able to set up transfers and use ACH, you must verify
the bank account yourself.
You cannot use a bank account that was verified by another user on the business account.
You must use a US-based bank account to connect for ACH payments; you cannot connect
USD bank accounts located in Canada.
Wise ACH Payment Limits
You can send up to 50,000 USD per 24 hours when paying with your connected bank
account (ACH).
On a personal account, you can send up to 250,000 USD over a 60-day period using a
connected bank account (ACH).
On a business account, you can send up to 400,000 USD over a 60-day period using a
connected bank account (ACH).
If your address is in Nevada, you can only send 10,000 USD or 50,000 USD per day via
ACH, depending on other factors.
If you try to send more than the allowed limit, you will not see the option to pay with your
connected bank account (ACH).
Wise ACH Payment Speed and Guaranteed Rate
It typically takes up to 4 working days for money sent via a connected bank account (ACH)
to reach Wise.
The debit from your bank account will usually appear within 2-3 working days after you make
the transfer.
You should ensure you have enough money in your account while you wait for the debit, as it
can take some time.
When paying with a connected bank account (ACH), the guaranteed exchange rate is
secured once you authorize the payment to Wise.
For other payment methods, the guaranteed rate is generally secured only after Wise
receives the money for the transfer.
It can take up to 4 business days for money to leave your bank account for an ACH
payment, depending on your bank.
Wise ACH Payment Verification and Security
Wise may ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) for verification, but no one at Wise will
have access to it.
If you do not have an SSN, Wise will ask for the reason, and you might be able to get
verified with another form of US ID.
If you only have an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), you must use a non-US
ID for verification instead.
If you do not receive a verification code by SMS, email, or phone call, you should check that
your bank has your correct contact details.
The verification code for 2-step verification is sent from your bank, not from Wise.
Wise ACH Payment Cancellation
You can cancel an ACH payment for a full refund within 30 minutes after you've paid, unless
the money has already been paid out.
If more than 30 minutes have passed and the money has not yet left your bank account, you
can still cancel the ACH payment at any time.
If the money has already been debited from your bank account for a cancelled ACH
payment, you will need to wait for the refund from Wise.
Troubleshooting Wise ACH Payments
If you have trouble logging into your bank, ensure your login details are correct and that they
are for your bank account, not your Wise account.
You may need to contact your bank to reset your password or confirm that your account
allows sign-ins on third-party platforms like Wise.
Wise may ask you to reconnect a bank account if your balance does not have sufficient
funds for the transfer.
Reconnecting your bank account refreshes your account balance, which can take up to one
working day to update.
Sometimes your bank may require you to re-verify your bank account connection to keep it
secure.
If your bank shows you have insufficient funds, it may be because it is checking all debits
from your account in the last 4 business days.
You will not be able to pay with your connected bank account (ACH) until other pending
payments clear from your bank account.
Managing Wise Connected Bank Accounts
You can view, add, or remove connected bank accounts from the Wise website, but this
feature is not currently available on the mobile app.
To connect a new bank account on the website, go to your profile, select 'Payment methods'

methods' and click 'Disconnect' next to the desired account.
You cannot edit a saved bank account; you must delete the account and connect it again to
make changes.
You can only connect local bank accounts in the US, UK, and Canada.
Wise Payments with Trustly
Trustly is a payment method available for bank accounts in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and
Denmark.
The name on your bank account must match the name on your Wise account to use Trustly.
Trustly does not support payments from business accounts.
It usually takes between 0 to 2 working days for a Trustly payment to be processed.
The time a Trustly payment takes can depend on the bank you are sending from, as some
banks have limits on instant transfers via Trustly.
The maximum amount you can send with Trustly is 1.2 million EUR, 8.5 million DKK, or 12.5
million SEK.
To pay with Trustly, you set up a transfer, choose 'Pay with Trustly' at the payment step,
select your country and bank, and follow the instructions.

of 10 working days.
Wise Payments with SEPA Transfers
SEPA stands for the Single Euro Payments Area and is a format for cross-border euro
(EUR) bank transfers.
The purpose of SEPA is to make cross-border EUR transfers within the area as easy as a
domestic transfer.
Wise has two SEPA-compliant EUR bank accounts, located in Estonia and Belgium.
When your bank sends a SEPA transfer, the money should reach Wise within minutes, or up
to 1 working day.
Recipients of a EUR transfer sent by Wise via SEPA should receive the money within 1-2
working days.
Banks should not charge fees for receiving SEPA payments, but a very small number may
still do so.
Wise Payments with Simple Bank Transfer
Simple bank transfer is a free payment method that uses Open Banking and works with your
online banking for EUR payments.
Simple bank transfer is only available when you are paying with EUR and if your bank
supports this method.
A Simple bank transfer can be instant if your bank supports instant transfers, or it can take
up to 1 working day.
The sending limit for a Simple bank transfer depends on your bank but is generally between
5,000 to 20,000 EUR.
If you try to send an amount higher than your bank's limit, the Simple bank transfer option
will not be available.
To pay with Simple bank transfer, you choose it at the payment step, select your country and
bank, and follow the on-screen instructions.

will open your mobile banking app to confirm.

Online bill pay is described as a cheap and convenient way to send Canadian dollars (CAD).
An online bill payment (OBT) can take 1 to 3 working days to arrive at Wise.
To pay with online bill pay, you must first set up your transfer in Wise and choose "Bill
payment" as the payment method.
After setting up the transfer in Wise, you must log in to your online bank and go to the "Bill
payments" section to complete the payment.
You need to add Wise as a payee in your online banking to use the online bill pay feature.
The payee name for Wise may be listed as "Wise" or "TransferWise" in your bank's system
because some banks have not updated the name.
When adding Wise as a payee for online bill pay, the payee province is ON (Ontario).
The account number required to add Wise as a payee is your Wise membership number,
which starts with a 'P' and should be entered without spaces or dashes.
Wise is listed as a bill payee with several Canadian banks and credit unions, including Bank
of Montreal, National Bank of Canada, EQ Bank, CS Alterna Bank, Manulife Bank of
Canada, and First Calgary Financial.
Wise is also listed as a payee with Central 1 Credit Unions, which includes many member
banks.
If you want to send a bill payment from a Central 1 Credit Union, you should set the transfer
up as a wire with Wise.
If your bank does not list Wise as a bill payee, you must contact them directly to request it be
added.
Paying with Direct Debit (EFT) in Canada
Paying by direct debit in Canada is also known as an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
payment.
When paying by direct debit, you enter your bank information to authorize a one-time debit
from your checking account.
You must authorize the payment on the Wise website or app each time you pay by direct
debit, as out-of-band payments are not accepted.
Direct debit payments from Canada usually take 1-2 working days to leave your bank
account.

debit payment to reach Wise.
You must ensure you have enough money in your account while waiting for the direct debit
to be processed.

The weekly sending limit for Canadian direct debit is 30,000 CAD.
For direct debit payments, the exchange rate is guaranteed once you authorize the payment

Paying with a Connected Account (VRP) in the UK
When adding money to your Wise account and paying with British pounds (GBP), you can
connect your bank account to avoid re-entering details for each payment.
Connecting your UK bank account is known as variable recurring payments (VRP) and is a
form of Open Banking.
Your bank does not share login details or account statements with Wise when using VRP; it
only sends the payment securely.
VRP payments are usually instant but can take up to 1 working day to reach Wise,
depending on your bank.
You can connect your bank account from your account settings on the Wise website, but this
option is not available on the mobile app at this time.
To connect your bank from settings, go to your profile, select "Payment methods,
" then
"Connected bank accounts,
" and follow the prompts.
You can also connect your bank account when you choose to add money to your GBP
balance and select "Bank transfer.
"
When setting up a VRP connection, you can configure limits for the amount per payment, the
total amount over a period, and the connection's expiration date.
To change the limits of an existing VRP connection, you must disconnect the account and
set up a new connection.
Your bank may have its own transaction limits that apply to VRP payments.
Paying with POLi in New Zealand
POLi is a payment system used for sending New Zealand dollars (NZD).

New Zealand, Kiwibank, TSB Bank, and Westpac.

PayID allows sending and receiving Australian dollars (AUD) using a recipient's unique
mobile number, email address, or Australian Business Number (ABN) instead of BSB and
account numbers.
You do not need to have your own PayID to send money with it, but your bank must offer the
PayID feature.
When sending AUD with Wise, you can choose PayID as the payment method.
To pay with PayID, you set up your transfer from AUD in Wise, log in to your online bank,
and choose to pay by email address.
You must transfer the exact amount to the unique PayID email address provided by Wise,
which will look similar to an email like 1234567@wise.com.
The transfer limit when paying by PayID is 50,000 AUD per transfer.
Your first payment to Wise using PayID may be delayed while your bank verifies the
payment, typically via a phone call or SMS text message.

Residents of Australia can also send money from their Wise account to any PayID recipient
in Australia.
Paying with an ACH Electronic Payment in the US
Wise accepts ACH electronic payments, but encourages using ACH Debit as it is considered
easier and safer.
If you are in a US state where Wise is licensed, you can use the same account details for
both wire and ACH electronic payments.
If you are in a US state where Wise works with a partner, the routing number for wire and
electronic payments is different.
The electronic payment routing number for states where Wise uses a partner is 026073150.
You should check with your bank to confirm if a payment is a wire or electronic to avoid
delays or using incorrect information.
Paying with a Wire Transfer
To pay with a wire transfer, you set up a transfer on Wise to get the correct account details,
then initiate the wire from your bank.
The name on the bank account used for a wire transfer must match your name on your Wise
account.
If a wire payment is rejected, for example due to a name mismatch, you might receive less
money back due to processing fees.
When paying with a domestic wire for US Dollars (USD), you can send up to 1,000,000 USD
from licensed states.
From Nevada or US territories, the USD domestic wire transfer limit is 50,000 USD.

Verifying your transfer
Wise Document Pre-Approval
Wise cannot approve documents before a user sends a transfer.
Because Wise reviews transfers on a case-by-case basis, the specific documents needed
are not known until the user's deposit is received.
Wise can offer advice on the documents that might be required for a transfer.
To get help, users can navigate to the Help section from the home screen drop-down menu
and then select "Contact us"
.
Wise Transfer Additional Checks
Wise sometimes performs additional checks on transfers to keep customers' money safe.
Additional checks on transfers usually take between 2 and 10 working days, but can
occasionally take longer.
When additional checks are performed, Wise will typically update the delivery estimate to
account for this.
Wise is a regulated financial institution and is required to perform these checks.
An additional check on a transfer does not indicate a problem with the transfer.
If Wise requires extra information from a user, they will be contacted.
Users should check their email, including the spam folder, for messages from Wise.
The progress of a transfer can be checked in the Activity section of a user's Wise account.
Wise Joint Account Verification
To verify a joint account, users must upload a screenshot or PDF of a bank statement.
The bank statement for a joint account must show the first and last name of the user.
The bank statement for a joint account must show the first and last name of the other
account holder.

correctly with the transfer.
Wise Verification Impact on Transfer Speed

personal and business customers will take 5 to 14 working days.
After a user or business is successfully verified, Wise will automatically resume the transfer
and send an email notification.
If more information is needed for verification, Wise will send the user an email.
A transfer cannot be sent until the verification process is complete.
To avoid transfer delays, users should check their email, including the spam folder, for
communications from Wise.
Sending money from your Wise account
Sending Money from a Wise Balance
Sending money from your Wise balance is faster and has lower fees for transfers over 1,000
GBP or its equivalent in other currencies compared to sending from an external bank
account.
Before you can send money from a Wise balance, you must first open a balance and ensure
it contains sufficient funds for the transfer.
To initiate a transfer from a Wise balance, you can go to one of your balances, which are
displayed at the top of the screen on both the web and the app, and select to send money
from there.
The process of sending money from a specific balance involves clicking "Send"
, selecting
the recipient, entering the amount, and then confirming the transaction, which may require
your Wise password, fingerprint, or facial recognition.
Another way to send money is to set up a regular transfer by clicking "Send" from the Home
tab and then choosing "Your Wise balance" as the payment method.
Wise Balance Direct Debits
You can authorize a company to collect regular payments from your account for things like
subscriptions or bills by setting up direct debits for AUD, CAD, GBP, EUR, and USD
balances.
Wise Transfers Cost
For most currencies, sending money from your Wise account to another person's Wise
balance in the same currency is free.
A change is coming for customers with an address in Hungary starting from February 2025
regarding the cost of sending money.
When sending money from your Wise account to a bank account outside of Wise, the fee
varies depending on the currency.
Wise will always charge a conversion fee if you send money to a different currency.
You can check the exact fee for a transfer by using the pricing page, where you enter the
amount and the currencies you are sending from and to.
Sending USD, EUR, or GBP to a country outside of the US, the SEPA Zone, or the UK will
result in a higher fee.
Wise Brazilian Real (BRL) Balance Rules
Due to local regulations, a financial operations tax called IOF (Imposto sobre Operações
Financeiras) is charged when you send or withdraw from a BRL balance in a different
currency.
If you are sending from a personal Wise BRL balance, you are only permitted to send funds
to external personal bank accounts that you own.
If you are sending from a Wise business BRL balance, you can only send money to external
business bank accounts owned by the same company.
Customers with a Brazilian BRL balance are not allowed to send money from their Wise BRL
balance to bank accounts belonging to other individuals or businesses.
Wise Scheduled Transfers
Scheduled transfers are payments you can set up to be sent on a future date of your choice.
You can schedule transfers for the same currencies that you can send normally, as these
transfers are sent from your Wise balance.
Scheduled transfers can be set up and managed on the Wise website and through the Wise
app.
To set up a scheduled transfer, you select "Send money,
" confirm the sending account, enter
the amount, and then click the calendar icon to choose the date and frequency of the
transfer.
You can schedule a transfer to be sent from your Wise balance; if you do not have a balance
in the currency you plan to send from, one will be created for you.
You must add money to your Wise balance before a scheduled transfer can be sent to your
recipient.
You can schedule payments at any time, but it must be at least two days in the future.
You cannot schedule a payment for the same day or the following day.
For time-sensitive transfers paid from a Wise balance, it is recommended to schedule it at
least 3 days in advance.
Wise will send a reminder to ensure you have enough money in your balance or bank
account for the transfer before the scheduled date.
The scheduled date for a transfer from your balance is the day the money is sent to the
recipient, not the day they receive it.
Your recipient should receive the money within 3 working days from the scheduled date of a
transfer sent from your balance.
If a scheduled transfer is funded from an external bank account, the scheduled date is when
Wise pulls money from your account, not when the recipient gets it.
It typically takes 1-4 working days for money from an external bank account to reach Wise
for a scheduled transfer.
A debit for a scheduled transfer from an external bank account will usually appear in your
bank account within 2-3 working days of making the transfer.
If a scheduled transfer falls on a weekend or bank holiday, some banks will not process it,
and Wise will send the money on the next working day.
In some locations, like the UK, bank transfers are processed 24/7, including weekends and
holidays.
If a monthly transfer is scheduled for the 30th or 31st and the upcoming month is shorter, the
transfer will be sent on the last day of that month.
Managing and Editing Wise Scheduled Transfers
You cannot edit the details of a scheduled transfer; you must cancel it and create a new one
with the correct information.
You can check the status of your scheduled transfers by going to the "Payments" section
and then selecting "Scheduled transfers" on the web or app.
When setting up a scheduled transfer, you can choose to send a fixed amount or set a fixed
amount for the recipient to receive.
If you choose to pay a fixed amount for a scheduled transfer, the amount the recipient gets is
an estimate because the exchange rate may change.
You can see the final amount your recipient received for a scheduled transfer by checking
the transfer details under "Scheduled Transfers" in the "Payments" section.
It is recommended to add extra money to your Wise balance for a scheduled transfer to
account for exchange rate fluctuations and avoid failed transfers.
Wise Scheduled Transfers Exchange Rates
Guaranteed exchange rates are not provided for scheduled transfers because the money is
sent at a later date.
Wise will send your scheduled transfer on the morning of the selected date using the
mid-market exchange rate at that time.
Failed Wise Scheduled Transfers
A scheduled transfer might fail for several reasons, and enabling notifications can help you
stay informed of any issues.
If a recurring scheduled transfer fails, Wise will still attempt to send the transfer on the next
scheduled date.
A scheduled transfer will fail if there is not enough money in your balance to cover the
payment.
If Wise needs more information from you for a scheduled transfer, they will email you, and
failure to respond by the scheduled date will cause the transfer to fail.
A scheduled transfer can fail if the recipient's information is incorrect or invalid.
Problems with an ACH bank debit in the US or a direct debit in Canada can cause a
scheduled transfer to fail.
Cancelling Wise Scheduled Transfers
A recurring transfer will end on the date you chose when you set it up.
If you did not set an end date for a recurring transfer or want to cancel future transfers, you
can do so under "Payments" and then "Scheduled transfers.
"
You can cancel a scheduled transfer up until 11:59 PM the day before it is scheduled to be
sent.
Wise Scheduled Transfers from USD or CAD
When sending from USD or CAD, you can connect your bank account to your Wise account
to allow for automatic debits for your transfer.
You must have a connected bank account before you can set up a scheduled transfer to be
paid by direct debit from USD or CAD.
Paying for a scheduled transfer via direct debit from a USD or CAD bank account adds up to
4 working days to the timeline before the transfer is sent.
Wise Scheduled Transfer Limits
If you live in Singapore, you can only schedule personal transfers below 5,000 SGD each
and up to a total of 30,000 SGD per year.
Sending large transfers
Wise Large Amount Transfer Bank Limits
Your bank may limit the amount of money you can send in a single transfer or per day.
Banks may have different sending limits for online, over-the-phone, or in-branch transfers.
Online or phone banking may have lower limits for sending money in one go.
Options for Sending Large Amounts Through Wise
To send a larger amount in one go, you can visit your bank branch in person.
Visiting your bank in person is a good option if the bank is easy to get to and you need to
send money quickly.
You can call your bank to ask if they will increase your transfer limit for a short period, such
as 24 hours.
Calling your bank to increase your limit is a good option if you cannot easily go to the bank in
person and need to send money fast, but not all banks offer this.
To send a large amount, you can add several smaller amounts to your Wise account balance
over a few days and then make the full transfer.
You can set up a normal transfer for the full amount and pay for it in several smaller amounts
without opening a balance.
If you choose to pay for a transfer in several smaller amounts, Wise will send an email
asking you to confirm this payment method.
If you pay for your transfer over several days, your guaranteed exchange rate is likely to
expire because the rate is only guaranteed for a specific period.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Verification
Wise will ask to verify your identity by checking your photo ID and address, which usually
takes about 2 working days.
To avoid delays, it is recommended to get your identity verified with Wise before setting up a
large transfer.
After you pay for a large transfer, Wise may require additional documents to verify the
source of the money.
If you are sending money from a joint account, you need to provide proof to Wise that you
are one of the account holders.
Sharing proof of a joint account, such as a scan or screenshot of a recent bank statement
with your name and account details, helps keep your transfer moving smoothly.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Documentation Requirements
When sending a large amount with Wise, you may be asked to provide documents to prove
where you got the money.
It is a good idea to have your documents ready before starting a large transfer to help speed
up the process.
Documents for a large transfer need to show your full name, the total amount that covers the
transfer, and the date you received the money.
It is best to provide as many of the requested documents as possible to prove the source of
your funds for a large transfer.
Bank statements can help verify the source of your money for a large transfer, but they are
usually not enough on their own.
You do not need to send documents to Wise in advance of a transfer, as they cannot be
checked before the transfer is set up.
You can send documents to Wise in their original language without needing to have them
translated.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Documentation for Personal Accounts
For money from a property sale, Wise may ask for documents showing the date you
received the money, the amount, signatures of the parties, property address, a description of
the property, and how long you owned it.
Examples of documents for a property sale include a sales contract, a letter from a solicitor,
bank statements, or property register extracts.
For money from a salary, Wise may request documents showing your role, annual salary,
employer's name and address, employment dates, and salary payment dates.
Examples of documents for salary income include recent payslips, the salary section of your
contract, a letter from your employer, or your last 3 months of bank statements.
For money from investments, Wise might ask for documents showing the date you received
the money, the amount, and the type of investments.
Examples of documents for investment income include investment certificates, contract
notes, or statements from your investment company or bank.
For money from an inheritance, Wise may ask for documents showing the date and amount
you received, the name of the person who made the will, their signature, and your
relationship to them.
Examples of documents for an inheritance include a signed copy of the will, a grant of
probate, a letter from a solicitor, or bank statements.
For money from a loan, Wise may request documents showing the amount borrowed, the
date you received it, the lender's name and address, and the purpose of the loan.
Examples of documents for a loan include extracts from your loan agreement, 3 months of
loan statements, or bank statements showing you received the money.
If you received money in another way, Wise might ask for documents showing the date, the
amount, and the reason you received it.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Documentation for Business Accounts
If you send a large amount from a Wise Business account, you may be asked to provide
documents.
For money from business revenue, Wise may ask for documents showing the business
name, transaction dates, transaction amounts, senders, and recipients.
Examples of documents for business revenue include business bank statements from the
last 3 months or audited financial statements.
For money from investments for a business, Wise may request documents showing the date
the business received the money, the amount, the type of investments, and the names and
signatures of the parties involved.
For money from a loan or third-party funding for a business, Wise may ask for documents
showing the date the business received the money, the amount, the names and addresses
of the parties involved, their signatures, the loan purpose, and the payment purpose.
If a business received money in another way, Wise might ask for documents showing the
date the business received the money, the amount, the names and signatures of the parties
involved, and the reason the business received it.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Costs
Wise uses the real exchange rate and charges a transparent fee for all transfers, regardless
of the amount.
Wise offers volume discounts on fees when you send larger amounts of money.
Eligibility for volume discounts is based on the total amount of money you send or convert
within a calendar month, based on UTC time.
When your total sending volume reaches certain thresholds, a lower fee is automatically
applied to the amount you send over that threshold.
The currency for the sending volume thresholds is determined by the registered address of
your Wise profile.
To receive discounted fees, you must send over a certain amount (e.g., 25,000 USD or
equivalent) within a calendar month and convert between currencies.
Sending transfers in the same currency does not count towards the volume for discounted
fees.
Only completed transfers or conversions count towards the volume for fee discounts.
The fee discounts work like tax brackets, where you only get the lower fee on the amount
that falls within each specific bracket.
Your personal and business Wise accounts may have different currencies for discount
thresholds if their registered addresses are in different regions.
A transfer must be completed before the end of the calendar month to qualify for lower fees,
as the threshold resets the following month.
Wise Large Amount Transfer Security
Wise is regulated by local authorities in every country it operates in, following rules designed
to protect consumers.
Wise safeguards your money by holding it in dedicated bank accounts or high-quality liquid
assets.
The money in your Wise account is covered by assets of equal value held in separate
accounts with financial institutions.
You can protect your Wise account with 2-step verification, which requires you to verify your
identity via text message, fingerprint, or face recognition for logins and transfers.
Wise has a dedicated anti-fraud team to protect customers, their money, and their data from
fraud.
Wise Sending Limits
Wise has limits on how much you can send, which depend on the currencies you are
sending to and from, and your payment method.
You can check the specific sending limits for each currency in the Currencies articles on the
Wise website.
Wise will notify you if you attempt to send an amount that is over the limit at one time.
Some currencies handled by Wise have limits on the amount you can send.
Wise Large Transfer Support
Wise has a specialized team dedicated to helping customers with transfers above 50,000
GBP or its equivalent.
Dedicated chat support for large transfers is available during specific hours for the UK, US,
and Australia time zones.
Wise Large Transfer Rules for Japanese Residents
Users with a registered address in Japan can send large transfers up to 150,000,000
Japanese Yen (JPY) or its equivalent.
The 150,000,000 Japanese Yen (JPY) transfer limit for Japanese residents only applies
when using the "Sending money" feature due to regulations.
For Wise users in Japan, sending money from balances or adding money to balances is
limited to 1,000,000 Japanese Yen (JPY) or its equivalent.
Withdrawing money from a Wise balance for users in Japan is limited to 1,000,000 Japanese
Yen (JPY) or its equivalent per withdrawal.
Wise accounts for Japanese residents have a default holding limit of 1,000,000 Japanese
Yen (JPY) across all balances.
The holding limit for Wise accounts in Japan can be increased up to 20,000,000 Japanese
Yen (JPY).
The specified holding and sending limits for Japan do not apply to users who live abroad.
How to Send a Large Wise Transfer from Japan
To initiate a large transfer from Japan on the Wise app or website, users must select "Send"
from the Home screen, choose a recipient, enter the amount, select a payment method via
the "Change" button, and then click "Continue"
.
When sending more than 1,000,000 Japanese Yen (JPY) at once from Japan, the Wise
balance cannot be used as the payment method.
For large transfers from Japan over 1,000,000 Japanese Yen (JPY), users must select an
alternative payment method, such as a Bank Transfer.
Wise Source of Funds Verification
Wise may require users to provide proof of the source of their money when sending a large
amount.
The requirement to prove the source of funds for large transfers is due to regulatory
obligations and to ensure the safety of the Wise platform.
A bank statement can be accepted by Wise as proof of source of funds if it shows the user's
name, account information, the full transfer amount, and the origin of the money with clear
transaction references.
If a bank statement does not meet the requirements, Wise will require other supporting
documents, such as a house sale agreement or proof of inheritance.
If the source of funds is salary or savings, Wise requires three months of bank statements
showing regular payment transactions instead of a statement showing the full transfer
amount.
Other documents Wise may accept for source of funds verification include an investment or
savings certificate, or a letter from a solicitor confirming receipt of inheritance.
Wise Large Transfer Timing and Urgency
Large transfers on Wise often require extra manual security checks that can extend the
processing time.
The delivery estimate provided by Wise for large transfers is accurate approximately 60% of
the time due to potential delays from extra security checks.
Wise cannot process large money transfers on an urgent basis.
For time-sensitive large transfers, users should contact the specialized Wise team in
advance to help prepare for the transfer, which may help speed it up.
To potentially speed up a large transfer, users should have their verification documents
ready to submit immediately if requested by Wise.
Wise Discounted Transfer Fees
Wise offers discounted fees for users who send over 20,000 Great British Pounds (GBP) or
its equivalent within a single month.
To qualify for Wise's lowest fee of 0.1%, a user must convert more than 2 million Great
British Pounds (GBP) or its equivalent in a calendar month.
The special 0.1% fee is applied only to the portion of the transfer amount that exceeds 2
million Great British Pounds (GBP).
The 0.1% discounted fee is only available when converting between Australian Dollars
(AUD), Canadian Dollars (CAD), Euros (EUR), Great British Pounds (GBP), or US Dollars
(USD).
The 0.1% fee pricing applies to balance conversions or when sending money from one Wise
balance to another Wise balance.
Conversions of over 2 million Great British Pounds (GBP) are restricted to market hours,
which are 00:00 to 20:30 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Monday to Friday.
Large conversions over 2 million Great British Pounds (GBP) cannot be processed if it is a
bank holiday in the country of the destination currency.
Australian residents and businesses have a lower transfer limit of 1.8 million Australian
Dollars (AUD).
Managing your recipients
Wise Recipient Management
When a user sends money to someone, Wise automatically saves their details as a
recipient.
Users can add recipient details before sending money.
To add a new recipient, go to the "Recipients" tab and select "Add a recipient"
.
Users must select the currency of the recipient's bank account and enter their bank details.
When adding their own account, users should select "Myself" after choosing to enter bank
details.
To add someone else as a recipient, users can find the person using their email address or
fill in their details manually.
Due to United States regulations, a recipient's residential or business address must be
added if the transfer is paid for with USD.
To delete a recipient, go to the "Recipients" tab, select the recipient to be removed, and then
select "Delete recipient"
.
Once a recipient is saved, their account details cannot be edited.
To change a recipient's account information, the user must delete the existing recipient
profile and add it again with the correct details.
Users can add a nickname to a recipient for organizational purposes.
Wise will always use the recipient's full account holder name for any transactions, as the
nickname is only for the sender's reference.
To set a nickname, go to the "Recipients" list, select the desired recipient, and choose "Add
nickname"
.
Correcting a Wise Transfer with a Wrong Recipient Name
The fastest way to fix a spelling mistake in a recipient's name is to cancel the transfer and
create a new one with the correct name.
Wise cannot provide a name amendment letter if the recipient's bank requests one.
If a recipient's bank asks for a name amendment letter, the sender must ask the recipient to
tell their bank to reject the payment.
Correcting a Wise Transfer with Wrong Recipient Bank Details
The most efficient way to correct wrong recipient bank details is to cancel the transfer and
set up a new one with the correct information.
Correcting a Wise Transfer with a Wrong Recipient Email Address
An incorrect recipient email address is not a problem if the money was sent to the recipient's
bank account using their bank details.
Using the wrong recipient email for a transfer made with bank details will prevent the
recipient from getting confirmation emails from Wise but will not stop the money's delivery.
If a user enters the wrong email for a transfer using bank details, they should notify the
recipient that the money was sent.
Entering the wrong recipient email is a problem if the transfer was sent to their email address
without using bank details.
If a money transfer is sent to an incorrect email address, Wise cannot complete the transfer
because the recipient will not get the email link to input their bank details.
The sender must contact Wise to fix a transfer sent to the wrong email address.
Cancelling a Wise Transfer
Whether a user can cancel a Wise transfer depends on its status in the system.
To check a transfer's status, users should log into their Wise account, go to "Home" to see
their activity list, and find the specific transfer.
A transfer can be cancelled if its status is "set up,
" "your money's on its way to us,
" or "your
money's being processed.
"
Handling a Completed Wise Transfer with Errors
If the cancel button is not visible or the transfer is marked "complete,
" it is out of Wise's
system and in the banking system, meaning Wise cannot make changes.
If a transfer with an incorrect name is already complete, the sender should ask the recipient
to contact their bank to check if the money can be delivered or if it will be returned to Wise.
If a transfer with incorrect bank details is complete, the sender should inform the recipient of
the error and ask them to contact their bank.
The recipient's bank can confirm if the money can still be delivered or if it will be sent back to
Wise.
Handling Returned Wise Transfers
When a user successfully cancels a transfer, Wise will send the money back to their bank
account.
If a bank sends money back to Wise, Wise will notify the sender via email.
After a transfer is returned to Wise, the sender can choose to set up the transfer again with
corrected details or cancel it for a refund.
If a Swift payment is returned by the recipient's bank, the sender can only get a refund to
their Wise balance or an external bank account.
Sending Money via Email with Wise
If a sender does not know the recipient's bank details, they can use the recipient's email
address to send money, which is a feature called Money to Email (M2E).
The Money to Email (M2E) feature is available only on the Wise website.
If the recipient has a Wise account, Wise will try to find their account details, as long as the
recipient has enabled this feature.
If the recipient is not on Wise, Wise will email them to request their bank details.
If the recipient does not accept the email transfer within one week, Wise will refund the
money to the bank account it came from.
Restrictions for Sending Money via Email with Wise
Sending money using only an email address is not possible when sending from Brazilian
Real (BRL) and Indian Rupee (INR).
Sending money using only an email address is not possible when sending to Sri Lankan
Rupee (LKR), Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), Colombian Peso (COP), Chinese Yuan (CNY),
Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), and Ghanaian Cedi (GHS).
An email-only transfer cannot be completed if the recipient does not have local account
details in the currency being sent.
Swift transfers are not supported for sending money to a recipient using only their email
address.
Sending over 1 million Japanese Yen (JPY) to a recipient using only their email address is
not permitted.
Finding Friends on Wise by Syncing Contacts
Users can sync their phone's contacts to find friends on Wise.
The option to sync contacts is available on the "Recipients" tab, during the process of
sending money, or within the "Security and privacy" settings.
Contact syncing is currently available only on the Wise mobile app.
To find a friend through contact syncing, their phone number must be verified on their Wise
account and match the number in the sender's phone contacts.
For a friend to be discoverable through contact syncing, they must have enabled the setting
to let people find them and have at least one open currency balance.
The contact sync feature can be used to send money to all currencies that Wise supports.
The contact sync feature cannot be used to send money to business accounts.
Wise User Privacy and Discoverability
Users can manage whether others can find them by their email, phone number, or Wisetag
in their privacy settings.
A user can remain private to prevent others from finding them while still being able to send
money to friends by syncing contacts.
Rates and fees
Wise Price Change Notifications
Wise will always let you know if and when the price of its fees change.
The way Wise communicates price changes depends on the type of fee and how it changes.
When Wise decreases its prices, the change is immediately available for all customers.
Wise will apply price decreases before notifying you so that you can benefit from the savings
as soon as possible.
If you have funded transfers from an account outside of Wise in the past 6 months, Wise will
notify you before a price increase.
If you use Assets, fund transfers from your Wise balance, convert currencies between
balances, or spend using the Wise card, you will be notified of a price increase within 7 to 62
days, depending on your location.
A notification period is the minimum number of calendar days between when Wise sends the
notification and when the change is implemented.
Customers in Australia and Canada receive a 30-day notification period for price increases
on balances and the Wise card.
Customers in Japan have a maximum notification period of 30 days for balances and the
Wise card.
Customers in Singapore receive a 7-day notification period for price increases on balances,
the Wise card, and Assets.
Customers in the USA have a 21-day notification period for price increases on balances and
the Wise card.
Customers in the United Kingdom and the European Union/European Economic Area have a
62-day notification period for balances and the Wise card, and a 14-day period for Assets.
Customers in any other country not listed have a 62-day notification period for balances and
the Wise card.
If you disagree with price changes, you have the right to close your Wise account.
Wise Dynamic Charges
When you transfer or convert money, you may see an additional fee in the calculator called a
dynamic charge.
Wise may add a dynamic charge when you are sending or converting a currency that is less
used around the world or when foreign exchange markets are volatile.
If you do not see a dynamic charge in the calculator when starting a new payment, it means
the charge does not apply to you.
Dynamic charges do not necessarily mean an increase in prices; they may also result in a
decrease.
Dynamic charges reflect the most current cost of exchanging currencies, which means they
can go up or down.
Wise uses dynamic charges to ensure its services remain available for currencies whose
exchange costs change often and quickly.
Wise Fees for Sending Money
The cost of a money transfer depends on the amount you're sending, how you pay, and the
exchange rate.
The more money you send, the more your transfer costs because the Wise fee is a
percentage of the amount sent.
If you are sending a small amount of money, a cheap, minimum fee is charged instead of a
percentage-based fee.
You will see how much each payment method costs when you set up your transfer.
Sending transfers of the same currency between Wise balances is free.
Wise always gives you the mid-market exchange rate, which is the rate banks use to trade
among themselves.
Wise Guaranteed Rate Transfers
A guaranteed rate is an exchange rate that is locked in for a specified period of time.
Wise offers a guaranteed rate on most transfers, but may not be able to when currency
markets are volatile.
To lock in a guaranteed rate, you must send your money to Wise right away so it is received
on time.
If your money does not reach Wise in time, your transfer will be converted using the
mid-market rate at that moment instead of the guaranteed rate.
The length of time a rate is guaranteed depends on the currency you're sending from, and
Wise will always tell you the duration when you set up the transfer.
The guaranteed rate will be honored once Wise has received the full amount for your
transfer within the specified time.
If you pay for a transfer with a method like ACH Direct Debit in the US, your rate is locked in
when you successfully authorize or complete the payment.
If you stay at one step of the transfer setup process for more than 30 minutes, the
guaranteed rate will refresh.
You cannot set up an unlimited number of transfers with a guaranteed rate.
If you set up a transfer on a weekend, you will receive the last exchange rate from before the
market closed on Friday.
For most countries, banks do not process transfers over the weekend, so weekends are
usually not counted when calculating guaranteed rates.
If a transfer has a 48-hour guaranteed rate and is set up on a Friday at 5:00 p.m., the rate
will be guaranteed until the following Tuesday at 5:00 p.m.
Wise reserves the right to cancel and refund your transfer if the rate changes by 5% or more
during the guaranteed rate period.
Wise Live Rate Transfers
A live rate transfer means your money will be converted using the exchange rate that is
active at the time your money gets to Wise.
With a live rate transfer, you will not know exactly how much your recipient will get when you
set up the transfer because the rate will change.
You can tell if your transfer is using the live rate because you will see a message saying the
exchange rate is not guaranteed when you set it up.
When a guaranteed rate is not available, you cannot send an exact amount using the
"Recipient gets" box in the calculator.
Wise Guaranteed Rate Transfer Customer Agreement Violations
Wise will remove the guaranteed rate feature from your account if there has been a violation
of the Customer Agreement.
Setting up multiple transfers to get the best rate, or setting up and cancelling transfers
without intending to fund them, are considered violations of the Customer Agreement.
You should not set up any transfers if you are still waiting to receive the money to fund them.
Transfers should only be set up if you have the deposit amount available.
Wise Alternatives to Guaranteed Rate Transfers
The removal of the guaranteed rate feature is not permanent and can be restored if you use
Wise in line with the Customer Agreement.
Wise cannot tell you how long it will take to get the guaranteed rate feature back, as it
depends on your past and future transfer activity.
If the guaranteed rate feature is unavailable, you can create and fund a transfer directly from
your Wise account as an alternative.
Without the guaranteed rate feature, you can use Rate Alerts to keep track of the exchange
rate.
Wise Rate Alerts
You can set up Rate Alerts to be notified the moment an exchange rate reaches your desired
amount or to receive daily updates.
You can manage your Exchange rate alerts by going to your profile, then to Notifications,
and editing your preferences.
