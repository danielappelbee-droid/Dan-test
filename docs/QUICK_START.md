# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Get your Wise prototyping environment up and running in 3 simple steps!

---

## Step 1: Install & Run

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd wisedemos-main

# Install dependencies (one-time setup)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**✅ Success looks like:**
```
✓ Ready in 1085ms
- Local:   http://localhost:3000
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to see the homepage!

---

## Step 2: Explore the Demo

Open the **Send Money Flow** from the homepage to see a complete prototype in action. This is the foundation you'll copy and customize for your own prototypes.

**What you'll see:**
- Home screen with account balances
- Recipient selection
- Currency calculator
- Payment method selection
- Confirmation and success screens

---

## Step 3: Start Building

Ask Claude to help you create a new prototype:

> "I want to create a new prototype based on the Send Money flow. Can you help me copy it and add a link to the homepage?"

Claude will guide you through:
1. Copying the Send Money folder
2. Renaming it for your prototype
3. Adding a card to the homepage
4. Making your first changes

## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: The server says "Port 3000 is in use"**
A: The server automatically uses the next available port (e.g., 3004). Look for the "Local:" URL in your terminal.

**Q: Can I view this on my phone?**
A: Yes! Ask Claude: "How do I access this on my phone?" or check [PHONE_ACCESS.md](PHONE_ACCESS.md)

**Q: I want to add AI chat to my prototype**
A: See [AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) - **Important:** You must use the WISECHAIN.md instructions (requires VPN access)

**Q: How do I know which components to use?**
A: Check [COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md](COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md) for a visual reference of all available components

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Claude Code**: This project is optimized for Claude Code. Just type prompts like normal conversation!
2. **Start simple**: Copy the Send Money flow first, then customize gradually
3. **Stay on-brand**: Always reuse existing components - check the Components Guide before creating new ones
4. **Test on mobile**: Most users will see your prototype on a phone - test there early and often
